### project 2
- Our focus should be on cluster 1, comprising individuals with both high Spending Scores and substantial income.
- Among these customers, 54 percent are women. To appeal to this group, we should devise a marketing campaign centered around the popular items found in this cluster.
- As for cluster 2, there is a promising chance to conduct a sales event targeting its customers, especially for popular items.

### project 4
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayrav13/olympic-track-field-results (Olympic Track & Field Results published on Kaggle)
- Tasks:
  - Use tableau to create a scatterplot with years on the X axis and performance on the  Y axis similar to the ones posted here:  https://www.kaggle.com/code/drgilermo/ahead-of-their-time
  - Create a multiple display chart in which years is the X axis and there are multiple displays of the chart in produced in 1 for the events I have selected. Different events have different ranges on the Y axis
    1. Include sports with times in the same range (for example, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m)
    2. Recode the Y variable in % improvements since the sports is introduced.
  -  Dashboards help us explore our data quickly. Create a dashboard in which the user chooses the event and the gender and the visual in 1 appears.
  - Create a connected scatterplot with the results from 2. On the X axis you have years on the Y axis you can have a variable of your choice (seconds, %improvement, or pace). Include in the connected scatterplot only the performance of the gold Metalist or the average of the performance of all medalists for a given year
  - Create the following visual presented in NYT for an event of your choice https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/05/sports/olympics/the-100-meter-dash-one-race-every-medalist-ever.html
  - Use python to find
    - Which sports the performance has increased or decreased the most?
    - In which sports the difference between men and women is the least/most (in percentage terms).
    - In which sports and years the difference between the gold and the silver is the greatest?
