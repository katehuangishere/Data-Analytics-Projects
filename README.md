### project2
- Our focus should be on cluster 1, comprising individuals with both high Spending Scores and substantial income.
- Among these customers, 54 percent are women. To appeal to this group, we should devise a marketing campaign centered around the popular items found in this cluster.
- As for cluster 2, there is a promising chance to conduct a sales event targeting its customers, especially for popular items.
